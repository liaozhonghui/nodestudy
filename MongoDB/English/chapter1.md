Mongodb is powerful, flexible, and scalable general-purpose database 
It combines the ability to scale out with features such as secondary indexes, range queries, sorting, aggregations, and geospatial indexes. 

This chapter covers the major design decisions that made mongodb what it is.

## Easy of use

document-oriented database, not a relational one.

the primary reason: to making scaling out easiler, and some other advantages.

allow embeded documents and arrays, and a single record can make complex hierarchical relation

predefined schemas: a document's keys and values are not of fixed types or sizes.

## Designed to Scale

scale up : getting a bigger machine 
scale out: partitioning data across more machines

scale out: to add storage space or increase throughput for read write operations, buy additional servers, and  add them to your cluster. 

## The Philosophy 

to create a fullfeatured data store that is scalable, flexible, and fast.
